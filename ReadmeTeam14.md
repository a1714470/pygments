## Introduction
  Our team is from the course Software Process Improvement at the University of Adelaide. We have chosen Tracebacks unreadable on dark styles #1526 fo Pygments to contribute.#1526 is that python tracebacks include content that is essentially unreadable on dark styles that are included with pygments. 
 ## Description:
  Our team follows the WCAGAA standard as criteria to solve this background contrast problem. The WCAGAA standard link is here(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html). We have already created a way to check if a style defines all colors and if the background contrast to a good standard. The "check.py" is used to fix the issue. We hope it can check all styles.
